#Part 2

#Write a function that reads a directory full of files and reports the number of 
#completely observed cases in each data file. The function should return a data frame 
#where the first column is the name of the file and the second column is the number of 
#complete cases. A prototype of this function follows

#You can see some example output from this function. The function that you write 
#should be able to match this output. Please save your code to a file named 
#complete.R. To run the submit script for this part, make sure your working directory 
#has the file complete.R in it.
